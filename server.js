[Provide a comprehensive 5-6 paragraph analysis covering:
1. Overall inflammation risk profile and primary drivers identified
2. Key modifiable factors with highest impact potential for inflammation reduction
3. Interconnections between factors (e.g., sleep affecting stress affecting diet)
4. Evidence-based anti-inflammatory strategies prioritized by effectiveness
5. Realistic timeline for inflammatory marker improvements with interventions
6. Holistic lifestyle approach emphasizing sustainable changes over quick fixes

Include specific medical references to UK guidelines (British Dietetic Association, NHS, NICE, British Heart Foundation, British Sleep Society), cite evidence-based anti-inflammatory practices including inflammatory biomarkers like CRP and IL-6, and provide practical, actionable recommendations based on their specific responses. Use empowering language that emphasizes controllable factors and realistic improvements.]

SCORING GUIDELINES:
- Score 0-25: Low inflammation risk, excellent anti-inflammatory practices
- Score 26-50: Moderate risk, good baseline with optimization opportunities
- Score 51-75: High risk, significant inflammatory burden requiring intervention
- Score 76-100: Very high risk, urgent lifestyle modifications needed

Focus on empowering, evidence-based, practical recommendations personalized to the patient's actual responses. Emphasize that inflammation is highly modifiable through lifestyle changes. ALWAYS provide specific, unique strengths - never leave blank or say "none provided". Use motivating language that promotes sustainable anti-inflammatory lifestyle changes.`,
