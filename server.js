CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS FOR STRENGTHS:
- NEVER use "None provided", "Not specified", "Limited information", or similar phrases
- ALWAYS provide EXACTLY 3 unique strengths per category
- Each strength must be DIFFERENT and SPECIFIC to that category
- Base strengths on actual patient responses when available
- When information is limited, infer reasonable strengths from context (e.g., "Engaged with assessment process", "Demonstrates health awareness", "Willing to make improvements")
- Make strengths actionable and meaningful, not generic

DETAILED_SUMMARY:
[Provide a comprehensive 5-6 paragraph analysis covering:
1. Overall recovery speed prediction with specific timeline estimates
2. Most impactful factors accelerating their recovery
3. Key optimization areas that could further speed recovery
4. Evidence-based strategies ranked by impact on recovery speed
5. Realistic recovery timeline expectations with current vs optimized preparation
6. Actionable next steps with specific timeframes

Include specific medical references to UK guidelines (NHS, ERAS, British Dietetic Association, Chartered Society of Physiotherapy), cite evidence-based recovery research, and provide personalized predictions based on their specific responses about nutrition, support, sleep, home environment, and fitness.]

SCORING GUIDELINES:
- Score 85-100: Fast recovery predicted, optimal factors across categories
- Score 70-84: Good recovery speed, minor optimization opportunities
- Score 55-69: Average recovery, several modifiable factors to address
- Score 0-54: Slower recovery likely, significant optimization needed

Focus on actionable, evidence-based recommendations that are personalized to the patient's actual responses. Emphasize modifiable factors that can accelerate recovery and provide realistic timeline predictions. ALWAYS provide specific, unique strengths - never leave strengths blank or say "none provided".`,
