# Assessment Funnel Bug Analysis

## Issues Found:

### 1. Missing Information Pages in Routing
Several assessments have `-information` pages in the quiz pages list but no corresponding route cases:
- `cardiometabolic-risk-score-information` - MISSING ROUTE CASE
- `resilience-index-information` - MISSING ROUTE CASE  
- `nutrition-body-composition-score-information` - MISSING ROUTE CASE
- `functional-fitness-age-test-information` - MISSING ROUTE CASE
- And others...

### 2. Incomplete isQuizPage List
The `isQuizPage` function is missing several assessment pages that should hide the footer.

### 3. Assessment ID Mismatch in Results Routing
The `currentAssessment` logic uses different names than expected in the database-processing navigation.

### 4. Missing Route Cases
Some assessments referenced in the database-processing logic don't have corresponding route cases.
